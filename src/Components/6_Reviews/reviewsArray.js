      "I just want you to know just how great my car comes out at your establishment, only problem you are too far for convenience. When I am in the area I always make sure to get the car washed by you.  I don't know what you do but the car looks better than new and people brag how good my car looks!!  I have a Sonic car wash that I must use because of my location and they don't come close to how my car glows with your system.  Do you have another car wash in the South Suburbs?  Just keep up the good work and whatever you use in the wash system don't change it.  Happy Customer (I never write a review!!)",

They take customer service to a level that is hard to find at other carwashes.If you want the best at a fair price, look no further than this carwash.",
